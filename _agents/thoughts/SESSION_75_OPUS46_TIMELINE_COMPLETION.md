# Session 75: Opus 4.6 — Timeline Gap Completion
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Agent:** Opus 4.6  
**Focus:** Fill all 5 remaining timeline gaps with verified, sourced events

---

## Context & Entry State
Picked up from Session 74 (also Opus 4.6). Repository at 498 tests, 25 files, build clean.

Previous sessions (72-74) had:
- Identified 8 timeline gaps, filled 3 (Charter 08, Liu Xiaobo Nobel, Term Limits Abolished)
- Added CCP influence detection system
- Added sanctions source URLs
- Split TODO into active + completed

## Key Decisions

### 1. Tiananmen Self-Immolation (2001-01-23) — Framing
**Decision:** Include as `falungong` category, `high` significance (not `critical`).
**Why:** This event is fundamentally disputed. Independent investigations (Washington Post, IED at UN) raised serious doubts about the official narrative. Falun Gong teachings explicitly prohibit killing/suicide. The event description must present both the CCP narrative and the independent findings, making clear that the CCP **used** this event — regardless of its authenticity — to escalate persecution. Labeling it `high` rather than `critical` reflects that the event's significance lies in its propaganda use, not as a watershed moment like Tiananmen 1989 or the NSL.

### 2. HK Article 23 March (2003-07-01) — Connecting the Arc
**Decision:** Include and explicitly connect to the 2024 Article 23 passage.
**Why:** These two events form a 21-year narrative arc. In 2003, 500,000 people marched and successfully blocked Article 23. In 2024, with all opposition crushed, it passed unanimously in 11 days. Including both events makes the erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms viscerally clear. The 2024 entry's details explicitly reference that it "fulfilled what 500,000 protesters blocked in 2003."

### 3. Wukan Protests (2011-09-21) — As Tragedy, Not Victory
**Decision:** Frame the Wukan protests honestly — initial success followed by reversal.
**Why:** Many accounts frame Wukan as a "rare victory." That's misleading. The elected village chief Lin Zuluan was arrested in 2016 and the land reforms were never implemented. The event is significant precisely because it shows the CCP's pattern: temporary concessions followed by retribution once international attention fades.

### 4. Tibet Self-Immolation Wave (2012-11-07) — Date Selection
**Decision:** Use November 7, 2012 as the date — the day 5 people self-immolated.
**Why:** The self-immolation wave doesn't have a single start date (first one was Feb 2009). November 7, 2012 was the deadliest single day (5 in one day) and occurred just before the 18th Party Congress. It represents the peak of desperation. Using a specific, verifiable date is better than a generic "2012" which wouldn't meet our date format requirements.

### 5. Article 23 Passage (2024-03-19) — Significance as "Critical"
**Decision:** Rate as `critical` significance.
**Why:** This completed the legal architecture for authoritarian control of Hong Kong. Combined with the 2020 NSL, Hong Kong now has two overlapping security laws with draconian penalties. It marks the definitive end of "One Country, Two Systems" as a meaningful framework.

## Source Verification Notes
All 5 events were cross-referenced against 2+ independent Tier 1-2 sources:
- 2001 self-immolation: Washington Post investigation (Philip Pan), HRW, IED UN statement
- 2003 Article 23: BBC, Reuters, HKFP
- 2011 Wukan: BBC, The Guardian, Reuters
- 2012 Tibet immolations: Free Tibet, ICT, HRW
- 2024 Article 23: HKFP, Amnesty, HRW, Reuters

## Impact
- Timeline: 26 → 31 events (filling all identified gaps from 2001-2024)
- Tests: 498 → 503
- No remaining chronological gaps — timeline now provides continuous coverage from 1989 to 2026
