1. **Prioritize:** USA/EU/Japan/Taiwan manufacturing
2. **Verify:** Check specific product lines (many brands have mixed manufacturing)
3. **Support:** Companies with transparent supply chains
4. **Minimize:** Reduce China exposure where possible

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- ❌ "Designed in USA, Made in China"
- ❌ No manufacturing location disclosed
- ❌ Vague "global supply chain" language
- ❌ Brands with Xinjiang cotton/aluminum links

### Green Flags to Look For:
- ✅ "Made in USA" with USA materials
- ✅ Transparent supply chain disclosure
- ✅ Fair Trade certified
- ✅ B-Corp certified
- ✅ Worker-owned cooperatives
