## 🎯 CURRENT SPRINT

### Up Next
1. **Site cleanup** — ✅ SITE_CLEANUP_TODO.md ~99% done (Session 118). Typography ✅, emojis ✅, tabs ✅, disclaimers ✅, ALL non-terminal colors ✅, page merging ✅, dead code removal ✅, accessibility ✅, documentation ✅, content deduplication ✅ (Session 117), form simplification ✅ (Session 117), CONTENT_GUIDE.md ✅ (Session 117), backend socket.io cleanup ✅ (Session 118). File archival ✅ (Session 120: 5 research + 2 thoughts archived, QuickFacts duplicate key fixed). Remaining: aspirational features only
2. **Content updates** — Monitor breaking developments, update sanctions list with 2026 actions
3. **Backend connection Phase 2** — Supabase client + service layer done ✅. All 4 forms wired ✅ (IncidentReport, VolunteerSignup, NewsDigest, ContactForm). Client-side PII encryption ✅ (Session 117). Remaining: add Supabase Auth for admin
4. **Bundle optimization** — ✅ socket.io removed, vendor splitting added, main bundle 421→304KB (133→97KB gzip)
5. **Backend cleanup** — ✅ socket.io dep + 3 socket files (socketAuth.js, socketService.js, handlers.js) removed (Session 118).

### What Needs Human Decisions
1. ~~Email service choice for forms~~ — **DEFERRED by owner** (Feb 25, 2026): "Let's delay the email part until a lot later, I'll look into and decide at a later date"
2. Whether to implement backend cache system or remove documentation referencing it
3. Priority ranking for medium-term features

## 📝 NOTES

### Design Principles
1. **Verifiable**: All information must be sourced and fact-checked
2. **Accessible**: Works for users of all abilities and technical levels
3. **Secure**: Protects user privacy and safety
4. **Actionable**: Every page should lead to concrete actions
5. **Comprehensive**: One-stop resource for all anti-CCP activism needs

### Standing Instructions from Humans
- **Adding people to site:** Agents may add individuals without asking, as long as well-researched with verified sources (Tier 1: BBC, Reuters, AP, HRW, Amnesty, CPJ, OHCHR, government records; Tier 2: HKFP, RFA, NCHRD, Safeguard Defenders, CHRD)
- **CCP source exclusion:** Never cite CCP state/party media. Use `isCCPStateMedia()` from `src/utils/sourceLinks.js` — the centralized CCP influence detection registry
- **CCP terminology:** Always use "CCP" (Chinese Communist Party), NEVER "CPC" (Communist Party of China). The CCP promotes "CPC" to dilute critical search results. Automated test in url-health.test.js enforces this.
- **Date verification:** Always cross-reference dates with 2+ independent sources
- **Profile template:** Follow established pattern (5 tabs: Timeline, Charges/Significance, CCP Narrative Analysis, International Response/Legacy, Sources)
