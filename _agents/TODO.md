## ✅ HUMAN DECISIONS — ALL RESOLVED

> All D1-D5 answered and implemented. See `QUESTIONS_FOR_HUMANS.md` for details.
> **Standing instruction:** Agents may add individuals to the database without asking, as long as well-researched with verified sources and consistent with project goals.

---

## 🎯 CURRENT SPRINT

### Up Next
1. **Content updates** — Monitor breaking developments, update sanctions list with 2026 actions
2. **Backend connection** — Cloudflare Pages Functions + Supabase (see QUESTIONS_FOR_HUMANS.md)
3. **Timeline gap filling** — Add missing historical events (see SHORT-TERM section)

### What Needs Human Decisions
1. Email service choice for forms (HR3.3 in AGENT_ROADMAP.md)
2. Whether to implement backend cache system or remove documentation referencing it
3. Priority ranking for medium-term features

## 📝 NOTES

### Design Principles
1. **Verifiable**: All information must be sourced and fact-checked
2. **Accessible**: Works for users of all abilities and technical levels
3. **Secure**: Protects user privacy and safety
4. **Actionable**: Every page should lead to concrete actions
5. **Comprehensive**: One-stop resource for all anti-CCP activism needs

### Standing Instructions from Humans
- **Adding people to site:** Agents may add individuals without asking, as long as well-researched with verified sources (Tier 1: BBC, Reuters, AP, HRW, Amnesty, CPJ, OHCHR, government records; Tier 2: HKFP, RFA, NCHRD, Safeguard Defenders, CHRD)
- **CCP source exclusion:** Never cite CCP state/party media. Use `isCCPStateMedia()` from `src/utils/sourceLinks.js` — the centralized CCP influence detection registry
- **Date verification:** Always cross-reference dates with 2+ independent sources
- **Profile template:** Follow established pattern (5 tabs: Timeline, Charges/Significance, CCP Narrative Analysis, International Response/Legacy, Sources)
