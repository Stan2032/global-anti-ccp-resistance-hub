# Source Bias Audit — CCP Propaganda & Influence Assessment

**Created:** 2026-02-19 (Session 24, Opus 4.6)  
**Purpose:** Identify and document potential CCP propaganda/influence risks in sources used by this platform.  
**Methodology:** Independent assessment of source ownership, funding, editorial stance, known compromises, and CCP targeting patterns.

---

## Why This Document Exists

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) operates the world's most sophisticated state-sponsored propaganda and information warfare apparatus. This includes:

- **Spamouflage / DRAGONBRIDGE**: CCP-linked covert social media influence operations (identified by Meta, Google/Mandiant, and Twitter/X)
- **State-controlled media masquerading as journalism** (Xinhua, CGTN, Global Times, People's Daily, China Daily)
- **United Front Work Department (UFWD)** operations targeting overseas Chinese communities
- **Overseas media ownership** (partly or fully through proxies)
- **CCP funding of academics, think tanks, and NGOs** to shape narratives
- **Lawfare** targeting credible researchers (Adrian Zenz, ASPI, Safeguard Defenders) through coordinated harassment, defamation, and fabricated rebuttals

Failure to identify CCP-tainted sources risks propagating disinformation that:
- Downplays or denies human rights abuses
- Discredits credible researchers through false equivalence
- Obscures the scale of internment and forced labor
- Provides legitimacy to authoritarian narratives

## Section 1: Known CCP State Media (NEVER USE AS SOURCE)

These outlets are directly controlled by or serve as mouthpieces for the CCP. They are **not independent journalism** and must **never be cited as credible sources** on this platform.

| Outlet | Why Disqualified | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Xinhua (新华社)** | Official CCP state news agency; publishes CCP official positions | Directly subordinate to the CCP Propaganda Department |
| **CGTN** (China Global Television Network) | CCP international propaganda broadcaster; formerly CCTV-9 | Registered as foreign agent in US; license revoked in UK |
| **Global Times (环球时报)** | CCP-linked nationalist tabloid; editorially subordinate to People's Daily | Known for aggressive anti-Western rhetoric and fabrications |
| **People's Daily (人民日报)** | Official newspaper of the CCP Central Committee | Primary CCP policy propaganda organ |
| **China Daily** | English-language CCP propaganda outlet | Distributed as paid inserts in Western newspapers (disclosed as foreign agent in US) |
| **Guancha.cn (观察者网)** | Ultranationalist Chinese outlet; echoes CCP positions | Sources for "Xinjiang no concentration camps" counter-narratives |
| **Dwnews (多维新闻)** | Overseas Chinese news with CCP-sympathetic stance | Ownership disputed; editorial line follows CCP |
| **Haiwainet (海外网)** | Run by People's Daily Group | Targets overseas Chinese diaspora |

**Rule:** If a claim appears ONLY in CCP state media, treat it as propaganda until independently corroborated by credible sources.

---

## Section 2: CCP-Influenced Sources (USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION)

These sources are not directly CCP-controlled but have known CCP influence, funding ties, or editorial slant toward CCP positions.

### 2.1 South China Morning Post (SCMP)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Ownership** | Alibaba Group (Jack Ma), acquired 2015 |
| **Editorial Stance** | Has shifted toward more pro-Beijing coverage since Alibaba acquisition |
| **CCP Pressure** | Faces potential censorship under Hong Kong National Security Law |
| **Credibility** | Still produces credible reporting; professional journalism standards maintained for news |
| **Risk** | Editorial choices and framing may minimize CCP abuses |
| **Use policy** | Use only for factual news reporting, not for analysis or opinion on CCP policies |
| **Bias Risk** | **MEDIUM** |

**Specific concerns:**
- Should NOT be cited for claims about Xinjiang, Tibet, or Hong Kong protest legitimacy
- News reports on factual events (court proceedings, government announcements) are generally reliable
- Editorials and opinion pieces should be treated with skepticism
- Cross-reference any SCMP-sourced claim with at least one independent source

### 2.2 Researchers/Academics with CCP Funding Exposure

Some academics at universities with CCP-funded Confucius Institutes or direct CCP research grants may have conflict of interest. Red flags:
- Received grants from PRC-linked bodies without disclosure
- Published in CCP-affiliated journals
- Attended CCP-sponsored research trips to Xinjiang (sometimes used to sanitize narratives)
- Published papers denying/minimizing Xinjiang abuses with limited evidentiary basis

### 2.3 Some Western Think Tanks with CCP Exposure

Not all think tanks with "China" or "Asia Pacific" in their name are compromised, but some have accepted CCP-linked funding:
- **Not compromised:** ASPI, Hoover Institution, Hudson Institute, Heritage Foundation (re: China research)
- **Exercise caution:** Some BRI-funded think tanks in developing nations
- **Research:** Always check funding sources for think tanks on China-related research

---

## Section 3: Sources Targeted by CCP Disinformation (VERIFIED CREDIBLE)

The CCP actively runs disinformation campaigns against credible sources. The existence of CCP attacks on a source is itself evidence of its credibility, not a reason to doubt it.

### 3.1 Dr. Adrian Zenz

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Position** | Senior Fellow, Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation; China researcher |
| **Credentials** | PhD in Social Anthropology, LSE; Postdoctoral at International School Schmalkalden |
| **Work** | Primary researcher on Xinjiang internment camp population estimates; published in peer-reviewed journals |
| **Corroboration** | His estimates corroborated by: ASPI satellite imagery, Xinjiang Police Files (leaked), BuzzFeed investigation, Australian government analysis, US State Department reports |
| **CCP Response** | Global Times has run 100+ articles attacking him; CCP foreign ministry regularly attacks his work in press conferences |
| **Assessment** | **CREDIBLE. CCP attacks on Zenz are themselves part of Spamouflage information operations** |
| **Bias Risk** | **NONE — CCP targeting is evidence of credibility, not reason for doubt** |

**Important note for future agents:** DO NOT treat CCP disinformation attacks on Adrian Zenz's work as legitimate counter-evidence. His methodology has been reviewed and supported by independent researchers globally. The coordinated CCP response is documented by Stanford Internet Observatory and others.

### 3.2 ASPI — Australian Strategic Policy Institute

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **CCP Response** | Attacked as "anti-China" by Global Times, CGTN; CCP regularly calls them biased |
| **Funding disclosure** | ASPI discloses all funding including defense industry; this transparency is used by CCP as a smear |
| **Xinjiang research** | Based on satellite imagery analysis, leaked documents; independently verifiable |
| **Assessment** | **CREDIBLE. Their Xinjiang Data Project is based on publicly verifiable satellite data** |

### 3.3 Safeguard Defenders

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Work** | Documented CCP overseas police stations; transnational repression reports |
| **CCP Response** | Attacked as "anti-China NGO"; CCP denies overseas police stations exist |
| **Verification** | Multiple governments (UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Canada) confirmed and closed stations following their reports |
| **Assessment** | **CREDIBLE. Real-world government actions validate their research** |

### 3.4 Xinjiang Police Files

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Source** | Leaked Chinese government documents provided to academics by anonymous source |
| **Verification** | Reviewed by international experts including Prof. Darren Byler, ASPI, BBC, Der Spiegel, Le Monde |
| **Authenticity** | Forensic analysis confirmed authentic by IT forensics expert Penelope Mooneyham and others |
| **Assessment** | **CREDIBLE primary source documentation of CCP internal operations** |

## Section 4: Spamouflage / DRAGONBRIDGE Detection Guide

Spamouflage (also known as DRAGONBRIDGE) is a CCP-linked covert influence operation that:
- Uses networks of fake accounts on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit
- Posts in English, Chinese, and other languages
- Creates fake news websites that mimic legitimate outlets
- Seeds pro-CCP narratives into Western discourse

### 4.1 Red Flags for Spamouflage Content

When evaluating sources or claims, watch for:

1. **Narrative alignment with CCP talking points:**
   - "Vocational training centers" language for internment camps
   - "Separatist" or "terrorist" framing for Uyghur activists
   - "Anti-China forces" language for critics
   - "Western interference" framing for human rights reports

2. **Suspicious source patterns:**
   - Claim appears only in CCP state media or unknown outlets
   - No byline or anonymous author
   - Website created recently, mimics legitimate news outlets
   - Content is in perfect English but published from China-linked domains

3. **Coordinated attack patterns:**
   - Multiple outlets simultaneously attacking the same researcher
   - Copy-pasted rebuttals appearing across many sites simultaneously
   - Academic papers published specifically to rebut credible researchers, with no independent verification

4. **Information timing:**
   - Claims released immediately after major CCP embarrassments
   - Timed to distract from or discredit verified reports

### 4.2 Known Spamouflage Tactics Against This Subject Area

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Survivor testimony attacks | CCP-linked accounts claim survivor testimonies are "paid fabrications" |
| Researcher smearing | Coordinated attacks on Adrian Zenz, citing non-existent "conflicts of interest" |
| Satellite imagery denial | Claims ASPI satellite data is "misinterpreted" or "fabricated" |
| "Both sides" false equivalence | Equating CCP mass internment with other countries' policies |
| Fake debunking sites | Websites that appear to fact-check but are CCP-funded |
| UN manipulation | CCP lobbied UN to have pro-CCP statement signed by 37 countries (vs. 39 condemning) |

## Section 6: Claims Verification Red Flags

When adding or reviewing data, watch for these patterns that may indicate CCP-influenced information:

### 6.1 Statistical Claims
- Numbers from CCP government sources only (population statistics, economic data)
- "Official" Chinese government numbers that contradict independent satellite/leaked evidence
- Claims that minimize internment numbers ("dozens" vs. "millions" for Xinjiang detainees)

### 6.2 Historical Revisionism
- Alternative framings of Tiananmen Square 1989 (CCP claims "it was handled correctly")
- Claims that Tibet was "always part of China" without historical context
- Denial of Hong Kong's pre-handover democratic trajectory

### 6.3 Legal/Judicial Claims
- Claiming CCP court proceedings are fair or independent
- Treating "national security" charges as legitimate legal actions
- Accepting "vocational training" framing for Xinjiang camps

### 6.4 About Activists/Prisoners
- Claiming political prisoners are "genuine criminals"
- Citing CCP-produced "confessions" as evidence
- Minimizing health deterioration reports by citing CCP official statements

---

## Section 7: Verification Protocol for New Data

Before adding any new data point to this platform:

1. **Source check:** Is this from a CCP state media outlet? → **REJECT**
2. **Ownership check:** Who owns/funds this source? Any CCP connections? → Flag if yes
3. **Corroboration:** Can this claim be verified by 2+ independent non-CCP sources?
4. **Researcher status check:** Is this researcher known to be CCP-targeted? → Their work is likely credible
5. **Date/recency check:** Is this information still current? (Facilities may close, prisoners may be released)
6. **Spamouflage check:** Does this claim appear on multiple CCP-linked sites simultaneously? → Likely disinformation
7. **Language check:** Does the source use CCP euphemisms ("vocational training", "re-education", "counter-terrorism")? → Note the bias

---

## Section 8: Questions for Future Agents

**Q-BIAS-1:** Should we add a visible "Source Bias Risk" indicator on the frontend for sources flagged MEDIUM or above?

**Q-BIAS-2:** Should we add a "How we assess sources" explainer page visible to users?

**Q-BIAS-3:** Should we proactively include the SCMP warning in DATA_SOURCES.md source listing?

*These questions are saved for human review. Work can continue in the meantime.*

## Change Log

- 2026-02-19: Initial document created by Claude Opus 4.6 (Session 24)
  - Comprehensive source registry bias assessment
  - Spamouflage/DRAGONBRIDGE detection guide
  - CCP propaganda outlet blacklist
  - Claims verification protocol

---

**Agent Assignment Note:** This document requires Opus 4.6 or equivalent. Assessing bias risk requires:
- Understanding of CCP information warfare tactics
- Knowledge of which researchers are CCP-targeted vs. genuinely compromised
- Ability to distinguish CCP propaganda attacks from legitimate criticism
- Context for why certain sources (Radio Free Asia, US gov-funded) are appropriate despite state funding
