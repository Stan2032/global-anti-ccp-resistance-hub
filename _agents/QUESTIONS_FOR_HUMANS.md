# Questions for Humans — Active Decision Queue

> **Location:** `_agents/QUESTIONS_FOR_HUMANS.md`
> **Purpose:** Ongoing list of questions that require human input. Agents add questions here rather than blocking on decisions.
> **Protocol:** Agents should check this file at session start. When a human answers, agents mark the question ✅ and implement.
> **Previous decisions:** See `_agents/archive/QUESTIONS_FOR_HUMANS.md` for D1-D5 (all answered and implemented).

## 📌 STANDING INSTRUCTIONS (from Humans)

These are permanent directives that apply to all agents:

1. **Adding people:** Agents may add individuals to the database without asking, provided well-researched with Tier 1-2 sources and consistent with project goals.
2. **CCP source exclusion:** Never cite CCP state/party media (Xinhua, CGTN, Global Times, etc.). Use `isCCPStateMedia()` from `src/utils/sourceLinks.js`.
3. **CCP terminology:** Always use "CCP" (Chinese Communist Party), NEVER "CPC". Automated test enforces this.
4. **Email/newsletter:** DEFERRED by owner (Feb 25, 2026) — decide at a later date.
5. **Continuous work:** Agents should work autonomously on improvements, adding questions here when human input is needed.

## 🔴 OPEN QUESTIONS (Awaiting Human Decision)

### Q6. Backend Cache System Documentation
**Asked:** Session 127 (Feb 27, 2026)
**Context:** `BACKEND_GUIDE.md` references a backend cache system, but no cache backend has been implemented. The documentation may set inaccurate expectations.
**Options:**
- **A) Remove cache references** from backend docs (keep docs honest about current state)
- **B) Keep as aspirational** — label clearly as "planned feature"
- **C) Implement basic cache** — add Cloudflare KV or Workers Cache API

**Agent recommendation:** Option A — honesty first. Cache can be documented when built.

### Q7. Priority Ranking for Medium-Term Features
**Asked:** Session 127 (Feb 27, 2026)
**Context:** The TODO.md lists many medium-term features without prioritization. Agents need guidance on what to build next. Key candidates:
1. **Offline Mode** — cache critical content for censored regions (high impact for target audience)
2. **API Development** — public API for researchers (enables ecosystem growth)
3. **Video Testimonials** — embedded survivor interviews (powerful but needs content sourcing)
4. **Discussion Forums** — moderated activist community space (complex, moderation risk)
5. **Analytics Dashboard** — privacy-respecting usage tracking (helps measure impact)

**Owner input needed:** Pick your top 2-3 priorities, or confirm agents should use their judgment.

### Q8. Supabase Auth for Admin Dashboard
**Asked:** Session 127 (Feb 27, 2026)
**Context:** Supabase client + service layer is integrated, all 4 forms are wired. The next logical step is adding Supabase Auth so an admin can view submitted reports. But this raises questions:
- Who should have admin access? Just the owner? Multiple trusted people?
- Should there be role-based access (admin vs. moderator)?
- Is a simple admin-only login sufficient for now?

**Agent recommendation:** Start with single admin login via Supabase Auth (email/password). Add roles later if needed.

### Q9. Tor Hidden Service (.onion)
**Asked:** Session 127 (Feb 27, 2026)
**Context:** The site serves activists in censored regions. A .onion address would allow access via Tor without exit node exposure. Cloudflare supports Onion Routing via the `Onion-Location` header.
**Options:**
- **A) Enable Cloudflare Onion Routing** — add `Onion-Location` header (minimal effort, Cloudflare handles it)
- **B) Defer** — not a priority right now
- **C) Set up dedicated .onion** — requires running a Tor hidden service (more complex)

**Agent recommendation:** Option A — it's a single header addition via `public/_headers` and significantly improves accessibility for at-risk users.

## 📝 FOR FUTURE AGENTS

When you encounter a decision that requires human input:
1. Add it to this file under **🔴 OPEN QUESTIONS** with a unique Q number
2. Include context, options, and your recommendation
3. Continue working on other tasks — don't block
4. Check this file at session start for any newly answered questions
5. When implementing an answer, move the question to **✅ ANSWERED QUESTIONS**

This file enables perpetual autonomous work. Agents should always have something productive to do, and questions accumulate here for humans to answer at their convenience.
