# China Exposure Level Rating System

## Purpose

To help users **completely remove themselves from brands that support the CCP**, we rate alternatives by their exposure to China's economy. Since the CCP has total control over all funds going in and out of any business inside China, even minimal exposure means supporting the regime.

## Rating Levels

### 🟢 ZERO CHINA EXPOSURE

**Definition:** Product has **absolutely no connection** to China's economy.

**Strict Criteria - ALL must be met:**
1. ✅ **Manufacturing:** 100% in democratic countries (USA, EU, UK, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Australia, NZ)
2. ✅ **Materials:** 100% sourced from democratic countries (no Chinese cotton, leather, metals, plastics, etc.)
3. ✅ **Components:** 100% made in democratic countries (no Chinese chips, circuits, fasteners, etc.)
4. ✅ **Assembly:** Final assembly in democratic countries
5. ✅ **Ownership:** Company NOT owned by Chinese entities
6. ✅ **Supply Chain:** Company publicly discloses supply chain and confirms no China involvement
7. ✅ **Verification:** Company provides documentation or certification of origin

**Examples:**
- **Red Wing Heritage Boots (USA)** - Leather from USA, made in Minnesota, documented supply chain
- **New Balance 990v5 (USA)** - Made in USA, USA materials, clearly labeled
- **Danner Mountain Light (USA)** - Made in Portland, Oregon with USA leather
- **American Giant Hoodie** - Cotton from USA, sewn in USA, transparent supply chain

**Reality Check:** 
- Very few products meet this standard
- Mostly limited to: clothing, footwear, furniture, some food
- **Electronics are nearly impossible** to get zero China

### 🟡 MINIMAL CHINA EXPOSURE

**Definition:** Product has **some unavoidable Chinese components** but minimizes support to CCP economy.

**Criteria - At least 3 of 4 must be met:**
1. ⚠️ **Final Assembly:** NOT in China (assembled in democratic countries)
2. ⚠️ **Major Components:** NOT from China (e.g., CPU, screen, engine made elsewhere)
3. ⚠️ **Primary Materials:** NOT from China (main fabric, leather, metal not Chinese)
4. ⚠️ **Company Transparency:** Publicly discloses what IS from China and actively working to reduce

**What's Acceptable:**
- Small electronic components (resistors, capacitors) from China when no alternative exists
- Minor fasteners (screws, rivets) from China
- Packaging materials from China
- **Less than 10% of total product value** from China

**What's NOT Acceptable:**
- Final assembly in China
- Main materials from China (cotton, leather, steel)
- Major components from China (screens, batteries, motors)
- Company hiding China involvement

**Examples:**
- **Framework Laptop** - Assembled in Taiwan, uses some Chinese components but transparent about it, actively working to diversify
- **Fairphone** - Assembled in China but transparent, working on ethical supply chain (NOTE: May need to move to Red)
- **System76 Laptops** - Assembled in USA, some Chinese components unavoidable in electronics
- **Some Toyota models** - Assembled in Japan/USA, some Chinese parts but minimal

**Reality Check:**
- Most electronics fall here
- Best we can do for phones, laptops, tablets
- Still **minimizes** CCP support even if can't eliminate it

### 🔴 SIGNIFICANT CHINA EXPOSURE

**Definition:** Product has **major Chinese involvement** that directly supports CCP economy.

**Disqualifying Criteria - ANY of these = Red:**
1. ❌ **Final Assembly in China** - Product assembled in China
2. ❌ **Major Components from China** - Critical parts (screens, batteries, engines) made in China
3. ❌ **Primary Materials from China** - Main materials (cotton, leather, steel) sourced from China
4. ❌ **Chinese Ownership** - Company owned by Chinese entities
5. ❌ **China Operations** - Company has factories, showrooms, or significant operations in China
6. ❌ **No Transparency** - Company refuses to disclose supply chain
7. ❌ **Xinjiang Links** - Any connection to Xinjiang (automatic disqualification)

**Examples of Red-Rated Alternatives (REMOVE FROM LIST):**
- **Fairphone** - If final assembly is in China (need to verify)
- **LG phones** - If manufactured in China
- **Any brand with China factories**
- **Any brand sourcing Xinjiang cotton/aluminum**

**Action Required:**
- **REMOVE from alternatives list**
- Replace with Zero or Minimal exposure alternatives
- If no alternatives exist, state "No suitable alternatives available" with explanation

## Special Categories

### Electronics (Phones, Laptops, Tablets)

**Reality:** Nearly impossible to achieve Zero China exposure due to:
- Global semiconductor supply chain heavily involves China
- Many electronic components only manufactured in China
- Even "Made in USA/Japan/Taiwan" uses Chinese parts

**Our Standard:**
- 🟢 **Zero:** Extremely rare, possibly non-existent for modern electronics
- 🟡 **Minimal:** Best achievable - assembled outside China, transparent about Chinese components, actively diversifying
- 🔴 **Significant:** Assembled in China, or major components from China, or no transparency

**Recommendation:** 
- Prioritize 🟡 Minimal for electronics
- Be transparent that complete avoidance is nearly impossible
- Focus on minimizing rather than eliminating

### Automotive

**Reality:** Global supply chains mean most cars have some Chinese parts.

**Our Standard:**
- 🟢 **Zero:** Car assembled in democratic country with documented supply chain showing no Chinese parts (very rare)
- 🟡 **Minimal:** Assembled in democratic country, minor Chinese components (less than 10% value), no Xinjiang aluminum
- 🔴 **Significant:** Assembled in China, or major components from China, or Xinjiang aluminum, or China operations

**Specific Concerns:**
- **Xinjiang aluminum** - Automatic Red rating
- **China factories** - Automatic Red rating (e.g., Volkswagen Xinjiang plant)
- **Chinese ownership** - Automatic Red rating (e.g., Volvo owned by Geely)

### Apparel & Footwear

**Reality:** Easiest category to achieve Zero China.

**Our Standard:**
- 🟢 **Zero:** Made in USA/EU/Japan with documented supply chain, no Chinese materials
- 🟡 **Minimal:** Made in democratic country, some Chinese materials (zippers, thread) but not main fabric
- 🔴 **Significant:** Made in China, or main fabric from China, or Xinjiang cotton

**Priority:** Should aim for 🟢 Zero in this category whenever possible.

## Verification Process

### How We Rate Alternatives:

1. **Check Company Website**
   - Look for "Made in" information
   - Check "About Us" and "Manufacturing" pages
   - Look for supply chain transparency reports

2. **Check Product Labels**
   - "Made in [Country]"
   - "Assembled in [Country] with imported components"
   - "Materials from [Countries]"

3. **Check Third-Party Sources**

## Limitations & Honesty

### What We Can't Guarantee:

1. **Hidden Supply Chains** - Companies may not disclose everything
2. **Changing Manufacturing** - Companies move production without announcement
3. **Sub-Components** - Impossible to trace every tiny part
4. **Materials Origin** - Raw materials may pass through China even if not "from" China

### Our Commitment:

1. **Best Effort** - We research thoroughly but can't guarantee 100% accuracy
2. **Transparency** - We show our sources and methodology
3. **Updates** - We update when new information emerges
4. **Honesty** - We admit when we don't know or can't verify
5. **User Input** - We welcome corrections and new information

### The Reality:

**Complete avoidance of China is nearly impossible in modern global economy.**

However, we can:
- ✅ **Minimize** support to CCP economy
- ✅ **Prioritize** alternatives with least China exposure
- ✅ **Be transparent** about what's unavoidable
- ✅ **Focus efforts** where complete avoidance IS possible (clothing, shoes)
- ✅ **Accept minimal exposure** where necessary (electronics) while choosing best available options
