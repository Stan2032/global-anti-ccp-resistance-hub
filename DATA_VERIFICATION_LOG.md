# Data Verification Log — Accuracy Audit with Direct Source Links

**Created:** 2026-02-19 (Opus 4.6)
**Purpose:** Track all factual claims verified, corrections made, and source URLs used.
**Agent Assignment:** Opus 4.6 — data verification requires cross-referencing multiple independent sources, distinguishing CCP propaganda from credible reporting, and precise date verification. Sonnet 4.5 may assist with formatting but should not perform independent claim verification.

---

## Verification Methodology

1. Every factual claim is checked against **2+ independent non-CCP sources**
2. Direct URLs are provided for the specific source used (not just the outlet name)
3. Dates are verified to the exact day where possible
4. CCP-tainted sources are flagged and excluded per SOURCE_BIAS_AUDIT.md protocols
5. Any claim that could not be independently verified is marked as UNVERIFIED

## Section 1: Jimmy Lai — Verified Facts with Sources

### 1.1 Conviction Date: December 15, 2025 ✅

| Claim | Verified Date | Sources |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Jimmy Lai found guilty on all charges | December 15, 2025 | [HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/15/breaking-hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-found-guilty-under-national-security-law/), [EU EEAS Statement](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/hong-kong-statement-spokesperson-verdict-jimmy-lai-case-15-december-2025_en), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-national-security-sedition-b2884398.html), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKSAR_v_Lai_Chee_Ying_%26_Others) |

**CCP Narrative Control:** CCP state media framed Lai as a "criminal" who "colluded with foreign forces to undermine national security." In reality, his "collusion" consisted of publishing a newspaper (Apple Daily) and meeting with foreign politicians — activities protected under international human rights law.

**Corrections Made:**
- Fixed multiple files that incorrectly listed the conviction date as December 19, 2024 (wrong year AND wrong day)
- Files corrected: EmergencyAlerts.jsx, LetterCampaign.jsx, CampaignProgress.jsx, Glossary.jsx, UrgentCaseTimer.jsx, NewsAggregator.jsx

### 1.2 Sentencing: 20 Years on February 9, 2026 ✅

| Claim | Verified Date | Sources |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Jimmy Lai sentenced to 20 years | February 9, 2026 | [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2026/02/09/hong-kong-publisher-jimmy-lai-sentenced-to-20-years), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/sentencing-in-jimmy-lai-case/), [CPJ](https://cpj.org/2026/02/jimmy-lai-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison-in-hong-kongs-biggest-media-trial/), [ABC News](https://abcnews.com/International/media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-sentenced-20-years-hong/story?id=129985406), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/hong-kong-media-tycoon-democracy-activist-jimmy-lai-sentenced-imprisonment.html), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-sentenced-20-years-prison-family-says-will-die-a-martyr/), [FDD](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2026/02/09/china-critic-jimmy-lai-handed-20-year-prison-sentence-by-hong-kong-court/) |

**Key Facts:**
- Sentence: 20 years — the harshest under the NSL to date
- Not eligible for parole until his late 90s (effectively a life sentence)
- Age at sentencing: 78 (born December 8, 1947)
- British citizen; UK denied consular access

**CCP Narrative Control:** CCP media presented the sentence as "lenient" compared to the maximum life sentence. In reality, 20 years for a 78-year-old means he will almost certainly die in prison. The CCP also frames the case as about "national security" when it is clearly about press freedom.

**Corrections Made:**
- Updated 20+ files across the codebase from "faces life imprisonment" / "sentencing pending" to "sentenced to 20 years (Feb 9, 2026)"
- Updated age from 77 to 78 in 5 files

### 1.3 Arrest Date: August 10, 2020 ✅

| Claim | Verified Date | Sources |

### 3.1 Report Dates ✅ (CORRECTED)

- 2026-02-20 (Session 26): Academic experts audit + deduplication (Opus 4.6)
  - **CRITICAL FIX: Elliot Sperling** — was listed as active Indiana University scholar. Died January 29, 2017. Entry updated with death date and marked as historical reference. Sources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Sperling), [Indiana University obituary](https://news.iu.edu/hamiltonlugar/live/news/37550-sgis-mourns-the-passing-of-prof-emeritus-sperling), [Legacy.com](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/elliot-sperling-obituary?id=20370298)
  - **FIX: Sophie Richardson** — was listed as "Chinese Human Rights Defenders" with no context. Updated: Co-Executive Director, CHRD (since Jan 2025); previously HRW China Director (2006–2023); Visiting Scholar, Stanford CDDRL (2024). Source: [NCHRD](https://www.nchrd.org/2025/01/sophie-richardson-joins-chinese-human-rights-defenders-network/)
  - **FIX: Elizabeth Economy** — title updated from generic "Hoover Institution" to "Hargrove Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution; Co-Chair, Program on the US, China, and the World." Previously Senior Advisor for China at Commerce (2021–2023). Source: [Hoover Institution](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy)
  - **FIX: Robbie Barnett / Robert Barnett** — was listed as TWO separate entries. Same person. Consolidated into single entry with full affiliation: SOAS (Professorial Research Associate) + King's College London (Lau China Institute). Formerly Columbia University Modern Tibetan Studies founding director (until 2017). Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Barnett_(scholar)), [KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/robert-barnett)
  - **Confirmed correct**: Sean R. Roberts at GWU (Associate Professor of Practice, Elliott School). Source: [GWU](https://elliott.gwu.edu/sean-roberts)
  - **Deduplication**: Removed duplicate Taiwan Association for Human Rights entry from human_rights_orgs_research.json (merged into single entry)
  - **Verified**: Police stations research entries for Canada, US, and Australia are NOT duplicates — they are separate stations in different cities (Toronto/Vancouver, NYC/LA, Sydney/Melbourne) with unique data. No changes needed.
  - Forced labor companies list: All 30 entries cross-referenced against ASPI "Uyghurs for Sale" report (March 2020). Company names, industries, and evidence descriptions match. UFLPA Entity List (144 entities as of 2025) targets Chinese manufacturers/suppliers, not Western brands — this distinction is correct in the data.

- 2026-02-20 (Session 27): Remaining data inaccuracy sweep (Opus 4.6)
  - **FIX: timeline_events.json event #14** (Jimmy Lai Arrested) — `sentence` field said "Guilty on all charges (Dec 2025), faces life imprisonment". Changed to "Guilty on all charges (Dec 15, 2025); sentenced to 20 years (Feb 9, 2026)". The "faces life imprisonment" phrasing was outdated after the Feb 9, 2026 sentencing.
  - **FIX: human_rights_orgs_research.json** — Hong Kong Watch entry had `latest_news` with wrong date "December 19, 2025" for Jimmy Lai verdict. Changed to "December 15, 2025" (the actual conviction date confirmed by HKFP, EU EEAS, The Independent).
  - **FIX: App.jsx line 257** — Sidebar said "Sentenced to life - Dec 15, 2025". TWO errors: (1) sentence was 20 years, not life; (2) sentencing was Feb 9, 2026, not Dec 15, 2025 (Dec 15 was the conviction date). Changed to "Sentenced to 20 years - Feb 9, 2026".
  - **FIX: ContactRepresentatives.jsx** — Template said HK47 "face up to life imprisonment". Outdated: HK47 were sentenced Nov 19, 2024 to 4-10 years. Changed to "were sentenced to 4-10 years in prison".
  - **FIX: liveDataService.js** — Zhang Zhan entry had `sentence: '4 years'`. Outdated: she received a second 4-year sentence in Sep 2025 (confirmed by OHCHR, Amnesty, CPJ). Updated to `'4 years (Dec 2020) + 4 years (Sep 2025)'` with updated description and lastUpdated date.
  - **FIX: liveDataService.js** — Jimmy Lai `lastUpdated` was '2025-12-15'. Updated to '2026-02-09' (sentencing date).
  - **FIX: CampaignHubs.jsx** — `nextMilestone` said "Sentencing expected 2026". Outdated: sentencing already happened Feb 9, 2026. Changed to "Appeal proceedings and international pressure campaign".
  - **Added**: `src/test/data-consistency.test.js` — 9 new tests ensuring critical date consistency across data files, preventing regression of corrected dates, verifying chronological ordering of timeline events, and checking that no CCP state media is cited as a credible source.

- 2026-02-20 (Session 28): Deep verification sweep — Timeline.jsx dates, CCP source exclusion, data file audits (Opus 4.6)
  - **CRITICAL FIX: Timeline.jsx Safeguard Defenders date** — was `2022-10-01`, doesn't match either Safeguard Defenders report. The description references "102 CCP overseas police stations in 53 countries" which is from the "Patrol and Persuade" report published December 4, 2022. Changed to `2022-12-04`. (Initial "110 Overseas" report was September 12, 2022.)
  - **CRITICAL FIX: Timeline.jsx "Xinjiang Camps Confirmed" date** — was `2019-03-01` citing ICIJ and NYT. This is wrong. The NYT "Xinjiang Papers" were published November 16, 2019 and the ICIJ "China Cables" on November 24, 2019. Changed to `2019-11-16`. Title also updated to "Xinjiang Papers Leaked" for clarity.
  - **FIX: Timeline.jsx event ordering** — Events were not in proper reverse chronological order. Reordered: Safeguard Defenders (2022-12-04) before UN Xinjiang Report (2022-09-01); Jimmy Lai Arrested (2020-08-10) before NSL (2020-06-30); Xinjiang Papers (2019-11-16) before HK Protests (2019-06-09).
  - **CONFIRMED: Causeway Bay Booksellers date** — October 15, 2015 is CORRECT. Gui Minhai and Lui Bo were both last seen on this date. Updated Section 7 to mark as verified.
  - **VERIFIED: No CCP state media source URLs in any data file** — Scanned all `src/data/*.json` files for domains: xinhua.net, cgtn.com, globaltimes.cn, chinadaily.com, people.com.cn, guancha.cn, haiwainet.cn, cctv.com. Zero matches found. All source URLs point to credible independent sources.
  - **VERIFIED: International response genocide recognition dates** — Checked all 10 key dates: US (Jan 19, 2021), UK (April 2021), Canada (Feb 22, 2021), Netherlands (Feb 25, 2021), France (Jan 20, 2022), Belgium (June 2021), Czech Republic (June 2021), Lithuania (May 20, 2021), Taiwan (Dec 27, 2022), New Zealand (May 5, 2021). All correct.
  - **VERIFIED: All 5 previously verified sanctioned officials dates consistent** — Chen Quanguo, Zhu Hailun, Wang Junzheng, Wang Mingshan, Carrie Lam.
  - **VERIFIED: SCMP RSS feed in liveDataSources.js** — Properly flagged with `biasRisk: 'medium'` and editorial warning about Alibaba ownership.
  - **Extended test suite**: Added 9 new tests (18 total in data-consistency.test.js): CCP source URL exclusion across ALL data files; sanctioned officials date verification; international response date verification; Zhang Zhan second sentence verification. Full suite: 198 tests, all passing.

**Agent Assignment Note:** This document must be maintained by Opus 4.6 or equivalent. Verification of CCP-related claims requires:
- Deep knowledge of CCP propaganda apparatus and tactics
- Ability to distinguish Spamouflage/DRAGONBRIDGE content from legitimate sources
- Access to web search for real-time verification
- Understanding of which sources are CCP-targeted (indicating credibility) vs CCP-compromised (indicating bias)

Sonnet 4.5 may format/organize but should not make independent judgments about source credibility for CCP-related topics.
