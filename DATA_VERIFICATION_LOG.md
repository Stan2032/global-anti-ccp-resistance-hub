# Data Verification Log — Accuracy Audit with Direct Source Links

**Created:** 2026-02-19 (Opus 4.6)
**Purpose:** Track all factual claims verified, corrections made, and source URLs used.
**Agent Assignment:** Opus 4.6 — data verification requires cross-referencing multiple independent sources, distinguishing CCP propaganda from credible reporting, and precise date verification. Sonnet 4.5 may assist with formatting but should not perform independent claim verification.

---

## Verification Methodology

1. Every factual claim is checked against **2+ independent non-CCP sources**
2. Direct URLs are provided for the specific source used (not just the outlet name)
3. Dates are verified to the exact day where possible
4. CCP-tainted sources are flagged and excluded per SOURCE_BIAS_AUDIT.md protocols
5. Any claim that could not be independently verified is marked as UNVERIFIED

## Section 1: Jimmy Lai — Verified Facts with Sources

### 1.1 Conviction Date: December 15, 2025 ✅

| Claim | Verified Date | Sources |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Jimmy Lai found guilty on all charges | December 15, 2025 | [HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/15/breaking-hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-found-guilty-under-national-security-law/), [EU EEAS Statement](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/hong-kong-statement-spokesperson-verdict-jimmy-lai-case-15-december-2025_en), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-national-security-sedition-b2884398.html), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKSAR_v_Lai_Chee_Ying_%26_Others) |

**CCP Narrative Control:** CCP state media framed Lai as a "criminal" who "colluded with foreign forces to undermine national security." In reality, his "collusion" consisted of publishing a newspaper (Apple Daily) and meeting with foreign politicians — activities protected under international human rights law.

**Corrections Made:**
- Fixed multiple files that incorrectly listed the conviction date as December 19, 2024 (wrong year AND wrong day)
- Files corrected: EmergencyAlerts.jsx, LetterCampaign.jsx, CampaignProgress.jsx, Glossary.jsx, UrgentCaseTimer.jsx, NewsAggregator.jsx

### 1.2 Sentencing: 20 Years on February 9, 2026 ✅

| Claim | Verified Date | Sources |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Jimmy Lai sentenced to 20 years | February 9, 2026 | [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2026/02/09/hong-kong-publisher-jimmy-lai-sentenced-to-20-years), [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/sentencing-in-jimmy-lai-case/), [CPJ](https://cpj.org/2026/02/jimmy-lai-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison-in-hong-kongs-biggest-media-trial/), [ABC News](https://abcnews.com/International/media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-sentenced-20-years-hong/story?id=129985406), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/hong-kong-media-tycoon-democracy-activist-jimmy-lai-sentenced-imprisonment.html), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-sentenced-20-years-prison-family-says-will-die-a-martyr/), [FDD](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2026/02/09/china-critic-jimmy-lai-handed-20-year-prison-sentence-by-hong-kong-court/) |

**Key Facts:**
- Sentence: 20 years — the harshest under the NSL to date
- Not eligible for parole until his late 90s (effectively a life sentence)
- Age at sentencing: 78 (born December 8, 1947)
- British citizen; UK denied consular access

**CCP Narrative Control:** CCP media presented the sentence as "lenient" compared to the maximum life sentence. In reality, 20 years for a 78-year-old means he will almost certainly die in prison. The CCP also frames the case as about "national security" when it is clearly about press freedom.

**Corrections Made:**
- Updated 20+ files across the codebase from "faces life imprisonment" / "sentencing pending" to "sentenced to 20 years (Feb 9, 2026)"
- Updated age from 77 to 78 in 5 files

### 1.3 Arrest Date: August 10, 2020 ✅

| Claim | Verified Date | Sources |

**Correction Made:** Timeline previously listed the 102-station report date as "2023-09-14" which was incorrect. Changed to "2022-12-04" — the actual publication date of the "Patrol and Persuade" report that identified 102+ stations.

**Agent Assignment Note:** This document must be maintained by Opus 4.6 or equivalent. Verification of CCP-related claims requires:
