## 📋 HANDOFF PROMPT FOR OPUS 4.6

```
# Context Handoff - Continuing LLM Model Swap Experiment

Hi! I'm switching to you (Opus 4.6) as part of an experiment testing LLM context preservation across model swaps. Please review the context below and continue the work as you deem best.

## 🎯 Current Task
Complete the LLM context flow experiment for the repository "Stan2032/global-anti-ccp-resistance-hub" by documenting findings about what happens when switching LLM models mid-session.

## ✅ Work Completed So Far
1. ✅ Explored repository structure and understood it's a React/Node.js web application
2. ✅ Created comprehensive `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md` document with:
   - Experiment methodology and setup
   - Key findings about context preservation
   - Context gaps and limitations discovered
   - Recommendations for multi-LLM workflows
   - Best practices and handoff protocols
3. ✅ Committed changes with detailed documentation
4. ✅ Created this handoff prompt template for future model swaps

## 📊 Current State
**Repository**: `/home/runner/work/global-anti-ccp-resistance-hub/global-anti-ccp-resistance-hub`
**Branch**: `copilot/test-llm-model-swaps`
**Last Commit**: "Add comprehensive LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md documentation with experiment findings"

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md` - Main experiment documentation (complete)
- `LLM_MODEL_SWAP_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` - This handoff prompt template (in progress)

## 🎬 What's Next
**Your mission**: Continue as you see fit! This is the experiment - can you:
1. Understand the full context from conversation history?
2. Review what's been done and validate it?
3. Identify if anything is missing or could be improved?
4. Continue work meaningfully without re-doing exploration?
5. Add your own observations about the handoff experience?

**Suggested Actions** (but use your judgment):
- Review the created `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md` file to understand the experiment
- Check if documentation is complete and comprehensive
- Consider adding a section about YOUR experience receiving this handoff
- Update the document with any meta-observations about model swap experience
- Run final validation (code review, etc.) before task completion
- Add any additional insights or recommendations based on your perspective

## 🔑 Key Context
- **Experiment Nature**: This IS the experiment - testing if you can pick up context and continue meaningfully
- **Documentation Location**: All findings are in `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md`
- **Repository Purpose**: Global Anti-CCP Resistance Hub (human rights documentation platform)
- **No Application Code Changes**: This task is purely documentation
- **Meta-Level**: You're now part of the experiment by continuing this work!

## 📝 Instructions for You
1. Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -5`
2. Read the created documentation: `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md`
3. Check progress report for task checklist
4. Validate completeness of the documentation
5. Add your own perspective on the handoff experience
6. Continue improving documentation or complete the task
7. **IMPORTANT**: Document your experience of receiving this handoff in the experiment findings!

## 🧪 Meta-Experiment Note
This handoff itself is part of the experiment! Your ability to understand this prompt, access the context, and continue meaningfully will validate or refute the recommendations in `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md`. 

Please confirm:
- Can you access the repository and files mentioned?
- Do you understand the task and what's been completed?
- What's your proposed approach to continue?

After confirming, proceed as you deem best! Your actions will provide data for the experiment.
```

## 🎯 Why This Prompt Works

This handoff prompt follows the best practices identified in the experiment:

### ✅ Explicit State Management
- Clear task description
- Enumerated completed work
- Specific file locations and commit references

### ✅ Context Anchoring
- Repository path and branch clearly stated
- References to concrete artifacts (files, commits)
- Links to documentation for deeper context

### ✅ Clear Next Steps
- Suggested actions but allows autonomy ("use your judgment")
- Explicit permission to continue as deemed best
- Meta-awareness that this IS the experiment

### ✅ Verification Instructions
- Specific commands to run for orientation
- Files to review for context
- Confirmation questions to validate understanding

### ✅ Meta-Level Awareness
- Explains this handoff is part of the experiment
- Invites new model to document handoff experience
- Makes the experiment self-referential and complete

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

When Opus 4.6 receives this prompt, it should be able to:

1. **Immediate Orientation** - Understand task within 1-2 tool calls
2. **Context Access** - Review files and commits without re-exploration
3. **Meaningful Continuation** - Add value rather than duplicate work
4. **Meta-Contribution** - Document its own handoff experience
5. **Autonomous Decision-Making** - Choose appropriate next steps

## 🔄 Iteration Notes

If the handoff doesn't work smoothly:
- Note specific context gaps discovered
- Update `LLM_MODEL_SWAP.md` with findings
- Refine this prompt template accordingly
- Iterate on handoff protocol recommendations
