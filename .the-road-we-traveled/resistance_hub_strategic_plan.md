## Vision and Mission Statement

### Vision Statement
To create the world's premier digital resistance hub that empowers individuals and organizations worldwide to effectively counter Chinese Communist Party influence operations, protect democratic values, and coordinate global resistance efforts through secure, accessible, and actionable intelligence platforms.

### Mission Statement
The Global Anti-CCP Resistance Hub serves as a comprehensive platform that connects resistance movements, provides secure access to leaked intelligence, facilitates community organization, and transforms passive awareness into active resistance through education, coordination, and direct action support.

### Core Objectives

The platform addresses four fundamental challenges identified through extensive research into current resistance efforts. First, the fragmentation of resistance movements across geographic and organizational boundaries limits collective impact and resource sharing. Second, the lack of secure, centralized access to leaked CCP documents and intelligence creates information asymmetries that benefit authoritarian operations. Third, the absence of real-time coordination mechanisms prevents rapid response to emerging CCP influence campaigns. Fourth, the limited accessibility of resistance resources excludes potential participants due to technical, linguistic, or geographic barriers.

Our strategic response involves creating an integrated ecosystem that connects disparate resistance efforts into a coordinated global movement. This includes developing secure communication channels that protect activists while enabling collaboration, establishing real-time intelligence feeds that provide actionable information about CCP operations, and building community support systems that sustain long-term resistance efforts.

## Research Foundation and Intelligence Assessment

### Current Resistance Landscape Analysis

The global anti-CCP resistance ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected but often isolated networks operating across different geographic regions, issue areas, and organizational structures. Through comprehensive research, we have identified key organizational clusters that form the backbone of current resistance efforts.

The Hong Kong democracy movement represents one of the most visible and well-organized resistance networks, centered around organizations like the Hong Kong Democracy Council [1]. Founded in 2019 by Hong Kongers amid the pro-democracy movement, HKDC operates as a Washington DC-based nonpartisan nonprofit that maintains international advocacy while supporting local resistance efforts. The movement has faced severe challenges following the implementation of the National Security Law, with recent bans on organizations like Hong Kong Parliament and the Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union demonstrating the escalating repression [2].

Tibetan resistance efforts are coordinated primarily through Students for a Free Tibet, a global grassroots network that works in solidarity with the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom and independence [3]. With over 100,000 Facebook followers and active chapters worldwide, SFT represents a mature organizational model that combines local activism with international advocacy. The organization employs non-violent methods including protests, lobbying, and awareness campaigns, demonstrating effective strategies for sustained resistance under authoritarian pressure.

The Uyghur resistance movement operates through the World Uyghur Congress, an international umbrella organization of exiled Uyghur groups that received the 2019 Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy [4]. The WUC promotes democracy, human rights, and freedom for Uyghurs while supporting peaceful, nonviolent, and democratic methods. Their work has been particularly crucial in documenting and exposing the systematic persecution occurring in Xinjiang through collaboration with investigative networks.

Falun Gong practitioners face what researchers describe as "the most targeted, oppressive, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world" [5]. The persecution campaign initiated in 1999 has created a global network of resistance that operates through information dissemination, legal advocacy, and awareness campaigns. This network demonstrates both the challenges of operating under intense repression and the resilience of decentralized resistance structures.

### Intelligence and Information Networks

The leaked information ecosystem represents a critical component of resistance infrastructure, providing documentary evidence of CCP operations that would otherwise remain hidden. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has emerged as the premier organization for processing and authenticating leaked CCP documents, with investigations including the China Cables and China Targets projects [6]. These investigations involve networks of 190+ investigative journalists across 65+ countries, demonstrating the scale of coordination required for effective intelligence operations.

The China Cables investigation revealed operating manuals for Xinjiang detention camps through documents that came to ICIJ via a chain of exiled Uyghurs [7]. This case study illustrates both the potential and challenges of leaked document operations, including source protection, authentication processes, and global distribution networks. The documents provided unprecedented insight into the systematic nature of CCP repression while highlighting the courage of individuals willing to risk their safety to expose authoritarian operations.

Radio Free Asia historically served as a crucial platform for independent journalism targeting Asian audiences, operating for 29 years before suspension due to funding uncertainty in 2025 [8]. The suspension of RFA operations represents a significant loss to the resistance ecosystem, creating an information gap that our platform must address. The organization's focus on China, North Korea, and Southeast Asia coverage, combined with its network of local correspondents and exile sources, provides a model for the type of journalism infrastructure needed for effective resistance.

The Epoch Times continues to operate despite facing systematic cyberattacks from CCP operatives, with twelve Chinese Communist Party operatives charged in connection with attacks on their operations [9]. Their specialization in Great Firewall technical exposés, transnational repression documentation, and Falun Gong persecution coverage demonstrates the type of specialized journalism that resistance movements require.

### Current Operational Challenges

The research reveals several critical challenges that limit the effectiveness of current resistance efforts. Fragmentation across organizational and geographic boundaries prevents coordinated responses to CCP influence operations. The suspension of Radio Free Asia due to funding uncertainty demonstrates the vulnerability of resistance infrastructure to political and financial pressure. The lack of secure, centralized platforms for sharing leaked documents creates information asymmetries that benefit authoritarian operations.

Security concerns represent a fundamental challenge, with CCP counter-operations including cyberattacks targeting news organizations, transnational repression campaigns harassing sources and journalists globally, and sophisticated disinformation efforts challenging document authenticity [10]. The technical arms race between resistance networks and authoritarian surveillance capabilities requires constant adaptation and resource investment.

Accessibility barriers limit participation in resistance efforts, with language barriers, technical complexity, and geographic restrictions preventing broader engagement. The need for secure communication methods conflicts with user-friendly interfaces, creating tension between security and accessibility that must be carefully balanced.
