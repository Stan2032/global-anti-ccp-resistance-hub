### C2: Fix VPN/Tor Detection Security Issue (CRITICAL - Security)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2026-02-19)  
**Priority:** CRITICAL SECURITY RISK → RESOLVED  
**From:** IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 1.1  
**Resolution:** Removed all fake detection; replaced with honest disclaimers and reputable third-party self-test tools

**Original Problem:** Used `Math.random()` to fake VPN/Tor detection  
**Solution:** Instead of implementing real detection (which has privacy implications), we:
1. Removed all fake detection code and misleading security indicators
2. Added honest disclaimers throughout ("This platform cannot detect whether you are using a VPN or Tor")
3. Added "Verify Your Connection" section with 4 reputable third-party self-test tools
4. Deleted orphaned SecurityWarning.jsx and Header.jsx (layout) dead code

**Owner Decisions (2026-02-19, Session 16):**
- **C2.1** No IP geolocation — CLOSED ✅
- **C2.2** No server-side detection — CLOSED ✅  
- [x] **C2.3** WebRTC leak detection — IMPLEMENTED ✅ (Session 16)
  - Built `useWebRTCLeakCheck` hook — runs entirely in-browser, no external APIs
  - Detects local and public IPs via RTCPeerConnection ICE candidates
  - Shows clear pass/fail status with remediation steps
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (security-critical, required understanding of WebRTC/ICE protocols)

- [x] **C2.4** Add honest security warnings ✅ (2026-02-19, Session 8-9)
  - Rewrote SecurityWarning component to remove false VPN/Tor detection claims
  - Added explicit disclaimer: "This platform cannot detect whether you are using a VPN or Tor"
  - Added EFF Surveillance Self-Defense link as security resource
  - Replaced fake "SECURE" badge, "Connection: Secure", "Status: Online" with honest alternatives
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (security-critical, required understanding of threat model)

- [x] **C2.5** Add reputable VPN/Tor self-test tools ✅ (2026-02-19, Session 13)
  - Added "Verify Your Connection" section to SecurityCenter Tools tab
  - 4 reputable third-party tools: check.torproject.org, ipleak.net, dnsleaktest.com, mullvad.net/en/check
  - Each tool has provider attribution and clear description
  - Fixed Tails URL: tails.boum.org → tails.net (domain moved)
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (security-critical, required judgment on which tools are reputable)

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY: Data Quality & Transparency

### H1: Source Attribution Throughout Site
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-19)  
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for credibility  
**Agent Action:** Executed autonomously  
**Best Agent:** Opus 4.6 (multi-file refactoring, source verification)  
**Backup Agent:** Sonnet 4.5 (can handle if pattern is clear)

- [x] **H1.1** Add SourceAttribution to Timeline component ✅ (2026-02-19)
  - **Time:** 30 min (faster than estimated - pattern already existed)
  - **Approach:** Added 13 missing sources to SOURCE_REGISTRY in sourceLinks.js
  - **Result:** All 27 timeline source names now resolve to clickable links
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (chosen: required verifying source URLs across multiple organizations)
  - **Subtasks completed:**
    - [x] Identified all unresolved source names in InteractiveTimeline
    - [x] Added European Parliament, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, ASPI, Xinjiang Police Files, Dr. Adrian Zenz, Hong Kong Watch, CNN, UK Foreign Office, Safeguard Defenders, FBI, Uyghur Tribunal, Nobel Committee
    - [x] Added test case verifying all timeline sources resolve
    - [x] Build passes, 123/123 tests pass

- [x] **H1.2** Add SourceAttribution to SanctionsTracker ✅ (2026-02-19)
  - **Time:** 20 min (faster than estimated)
  - **Approach:** Imported SourceAttribution, replaced hardcoded links with component
  - **Result:** 4 government sources now use consistent SourceAttribution rendering
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (chosen: component integration + source registry additions)
  - **Subtasks completed:**
    - [x] Added imports (SourceAttribution, resolveSource) to SanctionsTracker
    - [x] Added US Treasury OFAC, UK Sanctions List, EU Sanctions Map, Canada Sanctions to registry
    - [x] Replaced plain <a> links with SourceAttribution compact components
    - [x] Added test case verifying sanctions sources resolve

- [x] **H1.3** Add SourceAttribution to VictimMemorialWall ✅ (2026-02-19)
  - **Time:** 20 min (faster than estimated - component already used SourceAttribution)
  - **Approach:** VictimMemorialWall already imported SourceAttribution and resolveSource. Only needed to add 6 missing registry entries.
  - **Result:** All 16 victim sources now resolve to clickable links (1 generic "Historical records" intentionally unresolved)
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (chosen: source verification across human rights organizations)
  - **Subtasks completed:**
    - [x] Identified 7 unresolved source names (6 real organizations + 1 generic)
    - [x] Added Tiananmen Mothers, Human Rights in China, Wall Street Journal, Free Tibet, Stand News, Nobel Prize Committee to registry
    - [x] "Historical records" correctly stays unresolved (generic reference, no single URL)
    - [x] Added test case verifying all 16 VictimMemorialWall sources resolve
    - [x] Build passes, 124/124 tests pass

- [x] **H1.4** Integrate DATA_SOURCES.md into navigation ✅ (Already complete)
  - **Finding:** Route `/data-sources` already existed with full navigation integration
  - **Verification:** Confirmed route (App.jsx:366), header nav links (App.jsx:94, 203), footer link (App.jsx:379), RouteAnnouncer mapping
  - **Agent:** N/A (already done by prior work)

---

### H2: Remove Redundant Content
**Status:** Mostly Complete (2026-02-19) — 2 of 3 inline disclaimers addressed  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (downgraded - less severe than initially estimated)  
**From:** SITE_CLEANUP_TODO.md Priority 3  
**Agent Action:** Can execute autonomously  
**Note:** Initial estimate of "12+ repeated disclaimers" was overstated. Audit (2026-02-19) found only 3 inline disclaimers remain, 1 replaced, 2 are domain-specific (should stay as-is).

- [x] **H2.1** Create GlobalDisclaimer component ✅ (Already existed)
  - GlobalDisclaimer already exists at src/components/ui/GlobalDisclaimer.jsx
  - Supports 4 types: verify, sensitive, changing, security
  - Already adopted by 10 components
  - **Agent:** N/A (already done by prior work)

- [x] **H2.2** Remove remaining inline disclaimers ✅ (2026-02-19, partially)
  - **Result:** 1 of 3 replaced; 2 intentionally kept as domain-specific
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6
  - **Subtasks completed:**
    - [x] AIDisinfoDetector.jsx: Replaced inline disclaimer with `<GlobalDisclaimer type="verify" />`
    - [x] ForcedLabourList.jsx: **KEPT** — domain-specific disclaimer about supply chain complexity with bullet points; cannot be genericized without losing critical information
    - [x] LegalResourcesHub.jsx: **KEPT** — legal disclaimer may need specialized text for legal compliance; flagged for human review
  - **Decision Rationale:** Domain-specific disclaimers serve different purposes than generic "verify" disclaimers. Replacing them would lose important context about supply chain avoidance and legal limitations.

- [ ] **H2.3** Create single source-of-truth for repeated statistics
  - **Status:** DEPRIORITIZED (2026-02-19)
  - **Analysis:** Audit found "1 million" appears in 7 different natural-language contexts (Hong Kong marchers, Uyghur detainees, Apple Daily copies, bounties, Tibetan children). These aren't duplicates — they're prose references in different contexts. Creating a constant would over-engineer and reduce readability.
  - **Recommendation:** Leave as-is. Each instance is in a unique prose context.
  - **Best Agent:** N/A (not recommended to execute)

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: UX & Readability

### M1: Typography & Readability Improvements
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE via Global CSS (verified 2026-02-19)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Significant UX impact  
**From:** SITE_CLEANUP_TODO.md Priority 1  
**Agent Action:** Verified complete — changes in `index.css` already cover all subtasks  
**Best Agent:** Already done (global CSS approach more efficient than component-level)

- [x] **M1.1** Increase base font sizes globally ✅ (Already in index.css)
  - `text-xs` → 13px (was 12px), `text-sm` → 15px (was 14px) via `!important` overrides
  - Base body font: 16px, line-height: 1.7
  - **Location:** `src/index.css` lines 88-97
  - **Verification:** 2026-02-19 — confirmed these rules are active and applied globally

- [x] **M1.2** Improve text contrast ✅ (2026-02-19)
  - Upgraded `text-slate-400` and `text-slate-500` from #94a3b8 → #a8b5c7 for WCAG AA compliance
  - Upgraded `text-gray-400` and `text-gray-500` from #9ca3af → #a3aebb
  - Contrast ratio on slate-900 (#0f172a): ~5.5:1 (passes WCAG AA for all text sizes)
  - **Agent:** Opus 4.6 (needed to calculate and verify contrast ratios)

- [x] **M1.3** Add better line-height ✅ (Already in index.css)
  - Body: `line-height: 1.7`, paragraphs: `1.75`, lists: `1.8`
  - `text-xs`: `line-height: 1.5`, `text-sm`: `line-height: 1.6`
  - **Location:** `src/index.css` lines 27, 37, 92, 96, 117
  - **Verification:** 2026-02-19 — confirmed these rules are active

  - ResearchPapers, ConfuciusInstitutes, ImpactMetrics, Footer, EventMap
  - CaseStudies, SecurityQuiz, and more

- [x] **Emoji audit final count:**
  - Country flags: 177 KEPT (🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦🇭🇰🇹🇼🇪🇺 etc. — convey information)
  - Status indicators: 84 KEPT (✓✗✅🟢🟡🔴 — functional)
  - Content emojis: 17 KEPT (social share text, accessibility alerts, content warnings)
  - Decorative removed: 656 (70% of original 934)

### M3: Page Consolidation
**Status:** DEPRIORITIZED (2026-02-19)  
**Priority:** LOW (downgraded from MEDIUM)  
**From:** SITE_WIDE_TODO.md Priority 3  
**Agent Action:** Deferred — analysis shows merging would create oversized components  
**Note:** TakeAction is already 539 lines with 16 imported components. Merging CampaignHubs (413 lines) would create a 950+ line component, violating the <500 line goal. Better to keep as separate deep-link pages.

- [x] Removed 4 pages from navigation (Campaigns, Communications, CCP Tactics, Regional Threats) ✅

- [ ] **M3.1** Merge Take Action + Campaigns — DEPRIORITIZED
  - **Analysis:** TakeAction already imports CampaignProgress component. Full merger would exceed 500-line limit.
  - **Recommendation:** Keep CampaignHubs as deep-linked page. The `/campaigns` route is linked from Dashboard and TakeAction.
  - **Best Agent:** N/A (not recommended to execute)

- [ ] **M3.2** Merge Community + Communications — DEPRIORITIZED
  - **Analysis:** CommunitySupport (619 lines) + SecureComms (480 lines) = 1,099 lines. Far exceeds limits.
  - **Recommendation:** Keep as separate pages. SecureComms is already linked from Community.
  - **Best Agent:** N/A (not recommended to execute)

## ⏸️ RESOLVED: Previously Blocked Tasks (Owner Answered)

### HR1: Backend Architecture
**Status:** ✅ DECIDED (Session 16)  
**Owner Decision:** A) Stay static for now, B) add serverless later

**Recommended Stack (researched Session 16):** Cloudflare Pages Functions + Supabase
- Keeps hosting + functions on same platform (Cloudflare)
- Supabase for DB/Auth/Storage when needed (free tier, open source)
- No over-engineering: functions deploy alongside static site
- Best DDoS protection and censorship resistance for activist platform

**Next Steps (when ready):**
- [ ] **HR1.1** Create `/functions/api/` directory structure for Cloudflare Pages Functions
- [ ] **HR1.2** Set up Supabase project (when DB/Auth needed)
- [ ] **HR1.3** Implement first serverless function (contact form or incident report)

---

### HR2: Content Policy
**Status:** ✅ DECIDED (Session 16)  
**Owner Decision:** GitHub PRs from trusted contributors; consider user submissions later

- [x] Moderation via GitHub PR review process
- [ ] Future: Consider email-based submissions

---

### HR3: Service Decisions
**Status:** ✅ PARTIALLY DECIDED (Session 16)  

- [x] **HR3.1** Hosting: Cloudflare Pages ✅ (configured with _redirects + _headers)
- [x] **HR3.2** IP Geolocation: NOT NEEDED (owner decided no geolocation)
- [ ] **HR3.3** Email Service: Deferred for future decision
